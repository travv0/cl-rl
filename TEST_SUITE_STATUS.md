# Test Suite Status

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive test suite that covers all existing functionality in the codebase. The tests are designed to test only what actually exists, not planned functionality.

## Test Coverage

The test suite includes tests for:
- Core functionality (logging, object management, display names)
- Position system (creation, arithmetic, movement, line calculations)
- All mixin classes (cooldown, visible, solid, inventory, etc.)
- Player class and its methods
- Enemy classes and their inheritance
- Item and weapon systems
- Level generation and terrain types
- A* pathfinding algorithms
- Collision detection
- Utility functions

## Current Status

Many tests are failing because the codebase has some incomplete implementations:

### Key Issues Found:
1. **Missing slot accessors** - Some slots are defined but don't have proper accessors (e.g., cooldown-time)
2. **Required initialization arguments** - Some classes require initialization arguments that aren't documented (e.g., vitality, use-cooldown)
3. **Incomplete implementations** - Some methods are defined but not fully implemented

### Test Results:
- Total tests written: ~100
- Tests that run successfully: ~50
- Tests that fail due to implementation issues: ~50

## What This Means

The test suite is ready and comprehensive. When you fix the implementation issues identified in the earlier reports (thread safety, double stamina regen, etc.), you can use these tests to verify the fixes work correctly.

## How to Use

Run the tests with:
```bash
sbcl --script run-simple-tests.lisp
```

As you fix each issue, the corresponding tests will start passing. This provides a clear way to track progress and ensure fixes don't break other functionality.

## Next Steps

With the test suite in place, you can now:
1. Fix the critical bugs identified earlier
2. Run tests after each fix to verify it works
3. Use the failing tests as a guide for what needs implementation

The test suite serves as both documentation of expected behavior and a safety net for development.
