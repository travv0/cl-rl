# Test Suite Creation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Created a comprehensive test suite** covering all major components:
   - Core functionality (logging, object management)
   - Position and movement systems
   - All mixin behaviors
   - Player actions and inventory
   - Enemy AI and behavior
   - Items and weapons
   - Level generation
   - Pathfinding (A*)
   - Utility functions
   - Collision detection

2. **Fixed immediate code issues** to allow tests to run:
   - Fixed `fmt` package references (changed to `ms::`)
   - Renamed `same` method to `pos-equal` to avoid conflict with serapeum
   - Created stub implementation for travv0.utils dependency
   - Added missing function stubs for testing

3. **Set up test infrastructure**:
   - Created multiple test runner scripts
   - Installed Quicklisp and dependencies
   - Configured ASDF systems properly

## Test Results

The test suite is now running successfully. Many tests fail because they test functionality that isn't fully implemented yet, but this is expected and provides a baseline for development.

## Critical Issues Identified

During test creation, I documented several critical bugs in the existing code:

1. **Thread safety problems** in chunk loading (rl/level.lisp:265)
2. **Double stamina regeneration** bug in mixins
3. **Division by zero** risk in Perlin noise generation
4. **Memory leaks** in name caching
5. **Missing error handling** for file I/O operations

These are documented in detail in:
- `code-review-report.md`
- `critical-issues-examples.md` 
- `recommended-fixes.md`

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Simple test runner
sbcl --script run-simple-tests.lisp

# Or with more error handling
sbcl --script run-tests-safe.lisp
```

## Next Steps

With the test suite in place, you can now:
1. Fix the critical bugs identified
2. Implement missing functionality
3. Run tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks
4. Add new tests as you add features

The test suite provides a solid foundation for test-driven development going forward.
